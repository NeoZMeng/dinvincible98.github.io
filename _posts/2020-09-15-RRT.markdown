intro: Brief Description
description: This is a RRT challenge in MSR Hackathon at Northwestern University. Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) is a fundamental path planning algorithm in robotics. It consists of a set of vertices, which represent configurations in some domain D and edges, which connect two vertices. The algorithm randomly builds a tree in such a way that, as the number of vertices n increases to inifinity, the vertices are uniformly distributed across the domain D in R^n space.<br> For more information, please visit my github page below.
